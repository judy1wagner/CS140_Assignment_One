# CS_140_Assignment_One

My first programming assignment ever at Whatcom Community College. 

It prints a simple ASCII art dog, a number of bones based on the current month, and a calendar for the month input by a user. 

I believe the purpose of the assignment was to introduce us to Java print statements, the console, scanner, and methods.
